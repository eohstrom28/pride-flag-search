            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities
                are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Agender is a term used by people who experience little to no gender, experience a neutral gender,
                don't want to label their gender, and/or don't know or care about their gender. Agender only refers
                to a person's gender, so agender people can be any sexuality or romantic orientation. Agender people
                can use any pronouns they like or no pronouns, since <a href="../footer/faq.html#pronouns">pronouns
                don't equate gender.</a> Agender people can present in any way they like; they do not have to
                present in an androgynous way to be agender.</p>

            <p>Some agender people also identify as nonbinary and/or transgender, some see agender as its own
                gender identity, and some see it as not having a gender identity at all. As such, some agender
                people also identify as genderless, genderfree, gendervoid, genderblank, non-gendered, ungendered,
                and/or gendernull.</p>

            <p>The following quote is from Scottie (any pronouns), Director of a University LGBT Center, who is
                agender:</p>
            <p>“Gender always felt confusing to me. I never understood when people would describe a strong sense of
                their gender. I was mostly just frustrated about the whole idea and felt really lost. Then I came
                across the term agender and it completely opened up my world. For me, being agender feels right. I do
                not quite "fit" or "feel" a certain gender identity and prefer to reject cultural, gendered stereotypes
                while leaning into expressing myself in the ways that feel comfortable and bring me joy.”</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The agender pride flag was created by Salem X (tumblr user transrants) in 2014.</p>

            <p>The each color of the agender flag has its own meaning (except for black and white, which have the 
                same meaning). Salem X says they represent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Black and white: "absense of gender"</li>
                <li>Gray: "semi-genderlessness"</li>
                <li>Green: "nonbinary genders"</li>
            </ul>
