            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Demiromantic (often shortened to "demi" or "demiro") is a term used by people who only experience
                romantic attraction after developing an emotional connection or bond with someone. The nature of the
                bond can vary from person to person, but possibilities include friendship, a sexual connection,
                and/or other forms or combinations of forms. Forming an emotional bond with someone creates the
                possibility for a demiromantic person to feel romantic attraction, but does not guarantee it will
                occur. Demiromantic falls on the aromantic <a href="../../footer/faq.html#spectrum">spectrum</a>,
                so demiromantic people may also identify as <a href="./aromantic.html">aromantic</a>. Demiromantic
                people may experience other forms of attraction and can be any gender; the term only refers to a
                person's romantic orientation.</p>

            <p>Other definitions of demiromantic include only experiencing limited romantic attraction or falling
                somewhere between aromantic and alloromantic. These definitions can overlap with ones for 
                <a href="./grayromantic.html">grayromantic</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Demiromantic people can identify with another romantic orientation to describe the gender(s) of the
                people they eventually feel attraction to. They may even add "demi-" to the beginning of another
                romantic orientation label they identify with. Demiromantic people may also identify with another
                label on the aromantic spectrum, such as grayromantic.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The origin of the demiromantic pride flag is disputed. Some sources say it was created by pride-flags
                on Tumblr on September 30, 2014. Others say it was created by Tumblr user Queer as Cat in 2015.
                People believe was based off of the demisexual flag, the aromantic flag, and The Asexual Visibility
                & Education Network's logo.</p>

            <p>The colors of the demiromantic flag do not have official meanings, but they are assumed to be
                similar to those of the aromantic flag. Some possibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Black: the whole sexuality spectrum</li>
                <li>White: platonic and aesthetic attraction, queerplatonic relationships, being
                    outside the straight-gay and male-female binaries</li>
                <li>Green: demiromanticism, the aromantic spectrum</li>
                <li>Gray: grayromanticism and demiromanticism</li>
            </ul>
