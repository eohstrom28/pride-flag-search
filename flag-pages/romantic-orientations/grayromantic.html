            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because

            <p>Grayromantic (also spelled greyromantic, grayaromantic, or greyaromantic, often shortened to "grayro"
                or "greyro") is a term used by people who experience romantic attraction, but at a lesser frequency
                or intensity than the average alloromantic person. As such, grayromantic falls on the aromantic
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#spectrum">spectrum</a>, so grayromantic people may also identify as
                <a href="./aromantic.html">aromantic</a>. Grayromantic people may experience other forms of
                attraction and can be any gender; the term only refers to a person's romantic orientation.</p>

            <p>Grayromantic people's experiences can include feeling romantic attraction without wanting a romantic
                relationship, being unsure about how to identify romantic attraction (such as being unable to tell
                the difference between romantic and non-romantic feelings), feeling alienated from romance, only
                experiencing ambiguously romantic attraction, and/or only feeling romantic attraction in specific
                circumstances. These experiences, particularly the last one, can overlap with ones that
                <a href="./demiromantic.html">demiromantic</a> people have.</p>
            
            <p>Grayromantic people may identify with another romantic orientation to describe the gender(s) of the
                people they feel attraction to. They may even add "gray-" or "grey-" to the beginning of another
                romantic orientation label they identify with. Grayromantic people may also identify with another
                label on the aromantic spectrum, such as demiromantic.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The grayromantic pride flag was created by (now deactivated) Tumblr user lesbiandoe around September
                22, 2014. It was based upon the <a href="../sexual-orientations/graysexual.html">graysexual</a>
                flag, but has green for aromanticism (instead of purple for asexuality).</p>

            <p>Each color of the grayromantic flag has its own meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Green: aromanticism</li>
                <li>Gray: the transitional stage between aromanticism and alloromanticism</li>
                <li>White: alloromanticism</li>
            </ul>
