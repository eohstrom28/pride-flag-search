            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Queer is an <a href="../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella term</a> that refers to the entire 
                2SLGBTQIA+ community. It was originally used as a slur against 2SLGBTQIA+ people, but it has since
                been reclaimed. However, some people within the community do not like using it because of its
                negative history, so it should never be used to refer to a person unless they specifically use it to
                describe themselves.</p>
            
            <p>Queer has many definitions, so the meaning of the term can vary from person to person. It can be used
                to describe someone who is not exclusively heterosexual, can refer to someone's gender identity or 
                gender expression, and/or describe someone who has <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">fluid
                identities</a>. Some people use the term as an alternative to labelling their sexuality as gay,
                lesbian, bisexual, etc. because they find it less restrictive.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>There is no official flag for the queer identity, but the most recognized one is the chevron queer
                flag, which was created by Tumblr user bizexuals on October 5, 2016. This flag was created because
                the previous chevron flag did not consider sensory issues. It originally had a pure white background,
                but it was switched off-white on October 6, 2016.</p>

            <p>Each element of the chevron queer flag was chosen for a specific reason, with quotes from
                bizexuals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shades of lavender: historical association with the 2SLGBTQIA+ community</li>
                <li>Chevron shapes: non-straight lines, "our pride in the radical anti-assimilation of queer
                    identity"</li>
                <li>Off-white: "represents the queering of identities and the inherent non-straightness of queer
                    identity"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>One of the oldest queer flags was created by Pastelmemer on DeviantArt around August 17, 2015. Each
                color of this queer flag has its own meaning (although the stripes are grouped together):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pinks and blues: same-gender attraction</li>
                <li>Orange and green: nonbinary genders</li>
                <li>Black and white: the asexual, aromantic, and agender spectrums</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Another flag was created by bihetnaomi in 2016. It was created as an alternative to the chervon
                queer flag.</p>
