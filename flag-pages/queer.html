            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Queer is an <a href="../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella term</a> that refers to the entire 
                2SLGBTQIA+ community. It was originally used as a against 2SLGBTQIA+ people, but it has since been
                reclaimed. However, some people within the community do not like using it because of its negative
                history, so it should never be used to refer to a person unless they specifically use it to describe
                themselves.</p>
            
            <p>Queer has many definitions, so the meaning of the term can vary from person to person. It can be used
                to describe someone who is not exclusively heterosexual, can refer to someone's gender identity or 
                gender expression, and/or describe someone who has <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">fluid
                identities</a>. Some people use the term as an alternative to labelling their sexuality as gay,
                lesbian, bisexual, etc. because they find it less restrictive.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>There is no official flag for the queer identity, but the most popular one was created by Pastelmemer
                on DeviantArt in 2015.</p>

            <p>Each color of the queer flag has its own meaning (although the stripes are grouped together):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pinks and blues: same-gender attraction</li>
                <li>Orange and green: nonbinary genders</li>
                <li>Black and white: the asexual, aromantic, and agender spectrums</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another queer flag, the purple chevron queer flag, was created by Tumblr user bizexuals in 2016. 
                This flag was created because the previous flag did not consider sensory issues. It features
                shades of lavender because of their historical association with the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, chevron
                shapes because of their non-straight lines, and an off-white background color to reference white
                light (which is made of all the colors of the rainbow).</p>
