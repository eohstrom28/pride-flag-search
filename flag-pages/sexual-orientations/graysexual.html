            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because

            <p>Graysexual (also spelled greysexual, grayasexual, or greyasexual, often shortened to "gray-a" or 
                "gray-ace") is a term used by people who experience sexual attraction, but at a lesser frequency or
                intensity than the average allosexual person. As such, graysexual falls on the asexual
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#spectrum">spectrum</a>, so graysexual people may also identify as
                <a href="./asexual.html">asexual</a>. Graysexual people may experience other forms of attraction and
                can be any gender; the term only refers to a person's sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>Graysexual people's experiences can include feeling sexual attraction without wanting a sexual
                relationship, being unsure about whether they experience sexual attraction, only experiencing
                ambiguously sexual attraction, feeling alienated from sexual attraction, and/or only feeling sexual
                attraction in specific circumstances. These experiences, particularly the last one, can overlap with
                ones that <a href="./demisexual.html">demisexual</a> people have.</p>
            
            <p>Graysexual people may identify with another sexual orientation to describe the gender(s) of the
                people they feel attraction to. They may even add "gray-" or "grey-" to the beginning of another
                sexual orientation label they identify with. Graysexual people may also identify with another
                label on the asexual spectrum, such as demisexual.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The graysexual pride flag was created by Milith Rusignuolo and uploaded to Wikimedia Commons on June
                21, 2013.</p>

            <p>Each color of the graysexual flag has its own meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Purple: asexuality</li>
                <li>Gray: the transitional stage between asexuality and alloasexuality</li>
                <li>White: allosexuality</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The flag is symbolic of someone starting out with no sexual attraction, entering a single episode of
                sexual attraction, and then going back to having no sexual attraction.</p>
