            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Demisexual (often shortened to "demi") is a term used by people who only experience sexual attraction
                after developing an emotional connection or bond with someone. The nature of the bond can vary from
                person to person, but possibilities can include friendship or romance. Demisexual falls under the 
                asexual <a href="../../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella</a>, so demisexual people might also
                identify as <a href="./asexual.html">asexual</a>. Demisexual people may experience other forms of
                attraction and can be any gender; the term only refers to a person's sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>Another definition of demisexual is someone who experiences secondary sexual attraction, but not
                primary sexual attraction. Secondary sexual attraction develops over time and is based on the
                relationship and connection with a person. It is not based upon anything that is instantly available
                upon meeting someone, so it includes things such as personality and experiences. However, primary
                attraction is based upon information instantly available upon meeting someone, such as
                appearance.</p>
            
            <p>Demisexual people can identify with another sexual orientation to describe the gender(s) of the
                people they eventually feel attraction to. They might even add "demi-" to the beginning of another
                sexual orientation label they identify with. Demisexual people might also identify with another
                label on the asexual <a href="../../footer/faq.html#spectrum">spectrum</a>, such as
                <a href="">graysexual</a>.</p>
