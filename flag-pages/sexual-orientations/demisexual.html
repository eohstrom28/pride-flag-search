            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Demisexual (often shortened to "demi") is a term used by people who only experience sexual attraction
                after developing an emotional connection or bond with someone. The nature of the bond can vary from
                person to person, but possibilities include friendship, romance, and/or other
                forms or combinations of forms. Forming an emotional bond with someone creates the possibility for a
                demisexual person to feel sexual attraction, but does not guarantee it will occur.
                Demisexual falls on the asexual
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#spectrum">spectrum</a>, so demisexual people might also identify as
                <a href="./asexual.html">asexual</a>. Demisexual people may experience other forms of attraction and
                can be any gender; the term only refers to a person's sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>Another definition of demisexual is someone who experiences secondary sexual attraction, but not
                primary sexual attraction. Secondary sexual attraction develops over time and is based on the
                relationship and connection with a person. It is not based upon anything that is instantly available
                upon meeting someone, so it includes things such as personality and experiences. Conversely, primary
                attraction is based upon information that is instantly available upon meeting someone, such as
                appearance.</p>
            
            <p>Demisexual people can identify with another sexual orientation to describe the gender(s) of the
                people they eventually feel attraction to. They might even add "demi-" to the beginning of another
                sexual orientation label they identify with. Demisexual people might also identify with another
                label on the asexual spectrum, such as <a href="">graysexual</a>.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The origin of the demisexual pride flag is disputed; some sources say it was created on The Asexual
                Visibility & Education Network's website around 2010 (since it is based upon the asexual flag),
                while others say it was uploaded to Wikimedia by the creator, Vimopu, on April 22, 2013.</p>

            <p>Each element of the demisexual flag has its own meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Black triangle: the wider asexual community</li>
                <li>White stripe: sexuality</li>
                <li>Purple stripe: community</li>
                <li>Gray stripe: the wider graysexual community</li>
