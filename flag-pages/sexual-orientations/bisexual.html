            <summary>Definiton</summary>
            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Bisexual (often shortened to "bi") is a term used by people who experience sexual attraction to
                multiple genders, one's own gender and at least one more gender, and/or all genders. Bisexual people
                may or may not experience other forms of attraction and can be any gender; the term only refers to
                a person's sexual orientation. Bisexual is also an <a href="../../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">
                umbrella term</a> for identities that involve attraction to multiple genders, which is sometimes
                distinguished from the label itself as bisexual+ or bi+ (see more in the
                <a href="./bisexual.html#related-identities">Related Identities</a> section).</p>

            <p>Some bisexual people have preferences for particular genders (which may change over time), some feel
                more strongly attracted to specific genders, some feel equal attraction, and some experience
                attraction that is not linked to gender.</p>

            <p>Some bisexual people also identify as pansexual and/or use another label to describe their 
                sexuality, while others only use bisexual. Often, the terms bisexual, omnisexual, polysexual, and
                pansexual are confused with one another. The distinctions between the terms are frequently debated,
                so each person may define them differently. Ultimately, a person who experiences attraction to 
                multiple genders chooses which label(s) to use based upon their personal preference.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The bisexual pride flag was created by Michael Page, an LGBT activist, in 1998. It was first shown at
                BiCafe's first anniversary party on December 5, 1998. It was created to give the bisexual community
                its own symbol, similar to the rainbow pride flag, and increase the visibility of bisexual people,
                both in society and within the queer community.</p>
                
            <p>The colors were based upon the biangles (bisexual triangles), a popular symbol of bisexuality at the
                time, created by Liz Nania for the Boston Bi Woman's Community.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>The each color of the bisexual flag has its own meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pink: attraction to the same gender and similar genders</li>
                <li>Purple: attraction to multiple/all genders (the overlap of pink and blue)</li>
                <li>Blue: attraction to different genders</li>
            </ul>
