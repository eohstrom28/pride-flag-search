            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Pansexual (often shortened to "pan") is a term used by people who experience sexual attraction to
                multiple genders, all genders, and/or people regardless of gender ("gender-blind"). Pansexual people
                may or may not experience other sexual or romantic attractions, such as being on the asexual or
                aromantic spectrums, and can be any gender.</p>

            <p>Some pansexual people have preferences for particular genders (which may change over time), some feel
                more strongly attracted to specific genders, some feel equal attraction, and some experience
                attraction that is not linked to gender.</p>

            <p>Some pansexual people also identify as bisexual and/or use another label to describe their 
                sexuality, while others only use pansexual. Often, the terms bisexual, omnisexual, polysexual, and
                pansexual are confused with one another. The distinctions between the terms are frequently debated,
                so each person may define them differently. Ultimately, a person who experiences attraction to 
                multiple genders chooses which label(s) to use based upon their personal preference.</p>
            
            <p>The following quote is from Anna (she/her), President of SPEAK at Lehigh University, who is
                pansexual:</p>
            <p>“At this point in understanding myself, I feel most comfortable with the label of pansexual. To me,
                pansexuality means being attracted to people regardless of their gender. The interest is not so much
                about what gender a certain person is, but more about who they are as a person and how we connect
                with one another. This identity feels flexible because it decenters gender as the primary reason for
                attraction, and makes the focus a person's characteristics simply as a human being.”</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The pansexual pride flag was created by Tumblr user Jasper V., and was originally posted to an 
                anonymous account around 2010.
            </p>

            <p>Each color of the pansexual flag has its own meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pink: attraction to women</li>
                <li>Yellow: attraction to nonbinary people</li>
                <li>Blue: attraction to men</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Another interpretation is that the colors of the pansexual flag represent the genders of pansexual
                people.</p>
