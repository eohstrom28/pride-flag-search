            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Gay is a term used by non-women who experience attraction to non-women. The definition can vary
                greatly, as the term was originally only used to describe men who were attracted to men, but this
                definition is more inclusive, as it also includes nonbinary and trans-feminine individuals. Gay
                people may or may not experience other sexual or romantic attractions, such as being on the asexual
                or aromantic spectrums, or being bisexual. Gay people can present in any way they like, whether it
                be masculine, feminine, androgynous, or a combination of them. Gay can also be used as an
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella term</a> for LGBTQ+ identities.</p>

            <p>Homosexual is another term used to describe gay people, but not as often. Many prefer the
                term gay instead because homosexual was used when being gay was considered a mental illness or
                disease by anti-LGBTQ+ people. Because of this, some gay people may find being called homosexual
                derogatory and offensive. Some people prefer to call themselves gay because they believe the term
                homosexual is too focused on physical acts instead of attraction or romance. Other queer people
                do not use gay as a label to describe themselves because of the negative connotations with how the
                word is used in slang, undesirable cultural connotations, and/or because they find the label "gay"
                too restricting.</p>
            
            <p>The opposite of gay is straight (heterosexual).</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The gay (or Vincian) pride flag was created by Tumblr user gayflagblog on July 10, 2019. A
                5-stripe variant was also proposed along with it at the same time. They were created as an
                alternative to the original proposed gay pride flag. The proposed flag was created by Mod
                Hermy on DeviantArt on August 24, 2016 and was based on the lesbian flag. Due to
                <a href="https://beyondmogai.home.blog/2021/06/08/lets-talk-about-the-popular-and-sorta/">many
                controversies</a>, the 2019 flag was adopted in its place.</p>
