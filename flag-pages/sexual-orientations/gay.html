            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because

            <p>Gay is a term used by people who experience attraction to the same gender as
                themselves. This page focuses on non-women, as this flag is specifically for non-women, but you can

            <p>In this context, gay is a term used by non-women who experience attraction to non-women. Gay people
                may or may not experience other forms of attraction and can be any gender. Gay can also be used as 
                an <a href="../../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella term</a> for LGBTQ+ identities.</p>

            <p>Homosexual is another term used to describe gay people, but not as often. Many prefer the
                term gay instead because "homosexual" was used when being gay was considered a mental illness or
                disease by anti-LGBTQ+ people. Because of this, some gay people may find being called homosexual
                derogatory and offensive. Some gay people prefer to use gay rather than homosexual because they
                believe the term is too focused on physical acts instead of attraction or romance. Other queer
                people reject using gay to describe themselves because of the negative connotations with how the
                word is used in slang, undesirable cultural connotations, and/or because they find the label "gay"
                too restricting.</p>
            
            <p>The opposite of gay is straight (heterosexual).</p>
