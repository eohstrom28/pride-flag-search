                <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                    label without exactly matching the definition because
                    <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Lesbian is a term used by women, women-aligned people, and/or feminine-aligned people 
                    who experience attraction to people who identify similarly. The definition can vary greatly,
                    as the term was originally only used to describe women who were attracted to women, but this
                    definition is one of the more inclusive ones. Lesbians may or may not experience
                    other forms of attraction and can be any gender.</p>

                <p>Homosexual is another term used to describe lesbians, but not as often. Many prefer the
                    terms lesbian and/or gay instead because homosexual was used when being gay was considered a
                    mental illness or disease by anti-LGBTQ+ people. Because of this, some lesbians people may find
                    being called homosexual derogatory and offensive. Some people prefer to call themselves lesbian
                    because they believe the term homosexual is too focused on physical acts instead of attraction
                    or romance. Other queer people do not use gay or lesbian as a label to describe themselves
                    because of the negative connotations with how the words are used in slang, undesirable cultural
                    connotations, and/or because they find the labels "gay" or "lesbian" too restricting.</p>
                
                <p>The opposite of lesbian is straight (heterosexual).</p>
