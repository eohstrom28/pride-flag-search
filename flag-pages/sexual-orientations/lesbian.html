                <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                    label without exactly matching the definition because
                    <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Lesbian is a term used by non-men who experience attraction to non-men. The definition can vary
                    greatly, as the term was originally only used to describe women who were attracted to women, but
                    this definition is more inclusive, as it also includes nonbinary and trans-masculine individuals. 
                    Lesbians may or may not experience other forms of attraction. Lesbians can present in any way
                    they like, whether it be masculine, feminine, androgynous, or a combination of them.</p>

                <p>Homosexual is another term used to describe lesbians, but not as often. Many prefer the
                    terms lesbian and/or gay instead because homosexual was used when being gay was considered a
                    mental illness or disease by anti-LGBTQ+ people. Because of this, some lesbians may find being
                    called homosexual derogatory and offensive. Some people prefer to call themselves lesbian
                    because they believe the term homosexual is too focused on physical acts instead of attraction
                    or romance. Other queer people do not use gay or lesbian as a label to describe themselves
                    because of the negative connotations with how the words are used in slang, undesirable cultural
                    connotations, and/or because they find the labels "gay" or "lesbian" too restricting.</p>
                
                <p>The opposite of lesbian is straight (heterosexual).</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The lesbian pride flag was created by Catherine Becker (then taqwomen, now purrfectbycath on Tumblr)
                around July 25, 2018. It was one of many options in a poll called "Official Lesbian Flag Poll" that
                was posted on Tumblr and Twitter on June 30, 2018. This flag, which is called the community
                lesbian pride flag, was announced as the poll winner on August 28, 2018.</p>
            
            <p>The poll was created due to many controversies and issues with previously used lesbian flags:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The labrys lesbian flag was created by Sean Campbell, a gay graphic designer, in 1999 and was
                    the first flag specifically designed for lesbians. However, this flag had multiple issues,
                    including the labrys being used by some fascist organizations, the black triangle being
                    associated with Nazi Germany, the creator not being a lesbian, and transmisogynists using
                    the flag.</li>
                <li>The lipstick lesbian flag was "created" by Natalie McCray in 2010 specifically for lipstick
                    lesbians (very feminine lesbians) to use. However, McCray used did not attribute the flag design
                    to Fausto Fern√≥s, who created a cougar pride flag with a very similar design in 2008, meaning
                    McCray plagiarized. Other controversies surrounding the flag's creator involve her making racist, 
                    biphobic, transphobic, and other hateful comments, including ones toward butches (masculine
                    lesbians) and gender-nonconforming lesbians.</li>
                <li>The pink lesbian flag was created around 2013 by using the same stripe colors as the lipstick
                    lesbian flag and removing the kiss mark. This flag was meant to be for all lesbians, not only
                    lipstick lesbians. However, since it was based upon the lipstick lesbian flag, many see it as
                    not inclusive of butches and gender non-conforming lesbians.</li>
                <li>A pink and orange lesbian flag was created by Tumblr user shapeshifter-of-constellation
                    on July 3, 2017. This flag combined 3 pink stripes from the lipstick lesbian/pink flag with 3
                    orange stripes from the butch flag (created by Mod Q of the butch positivity Tumblr blog in
                    June 2017). A white stripe was placed in between the pink and orange stripes to represent lesbians
                    who are neither butch nor femme. The flag was misunderstood to be a combined butch and femme flag,
                    instead of being a flag for all lesbians, although shapeshifter-of-constellation did later clarify
                    this.</li>
                <li>The sunset lesbian flag was "created" by Emily Gwen in June 2018. Aside from swapping the orange
                    stripes to be on top and pink stripes on the bottom and resizing the flag, it is very
                    similar to the flag created by shapeshifter-of-constellation.</li>

            <p>Another lesbian flag was created by Lydia (lydiandragon), who expressed concerns about some people
                wanting to use the lipstick lesbian flag to represent all lesbians. The flag colors were based upon
                a poem written by Sappho, a lesbian poet from ancient Greece. The color order was originally
                different (purple, yellow, green, then pink), and current color order was suggested by Maya Kern.
                The color meanings are: sapphic love (purple), fragility (pink), strength (yellow), and healing
                (green).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dark orange: transgressive womanhood</li>
                <li>Light orange: community</li>
                <li>White: gender non-conformity</li>
                <li>Light pink: freedom</li>
