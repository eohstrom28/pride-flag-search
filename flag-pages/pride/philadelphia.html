            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The Philadelphia Pride flag (also called the More Color More Pride flag or the Philly Pride flag)
                was created in 2017 as part of a citywide campaign called "More Color More Pride". After some 
                high-profile news stories exposed racism in Philadelphia's Gayborhood in 2016, many people,
                particularly people of color, called for more inclusion and intersectionality in the city's LGBTQ+
                community. Although there had been conversations about discrimination in the past, not much had been 
                done about it. This flag was created to represent the legacy of activism, call for change, and make
                sure that inclusion also meant including LGBTQ+ people of color.</p>

            <p>The flag was created by Philadelphia's Office of LGBT Affairs and Tierney, a design agency, in May
                2017. They  used <a href="./rainbow.html">Gilbert Baker's 6-stripe rainbow flag</a> and added black
                and brown stripes to the top. The flag was unveiled during Philadelphia Pride celebrations in June
                2017, and it has since then gotten recognition around the world.
                <!--Link to progress pride and intersex-inclusive progress pride flag pages-->
                This design even inspired the <a href="">Progress Pride flag</a> and the
                <a href="">Intersex-Inclusive Progress Pride flag</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Each color of the Philadelphia Pride flag has its own meaning (with the rainbow color meanings taken
                from Gilbert Baker's design):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Black and Brown: LGBTQ+ people of color, including their experiences, contributions, and
                    struggles within the community</li>
                <li>Red: life</li>
                <li>Orange: healing</li>
                <li>Yellow: sunlight</li>
                <li>Green: nature</li>
                <li>Blue: serenity, harmony</li>
                <li>Purple: spirit</li>
            </ul>
