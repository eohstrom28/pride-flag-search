            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Intersex is an <a href="../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella term</a> that refers to people 
                with sex characteristics and/or reproductive anatomy (genitalia, gonads, internal anatomy, hormones,
                and/or chromosomes) that differ from the ones associated with the male or female binary. Intersex
                people are born with these differences or develop them during childhood. Because of this, they are
                often coerced or forced to change their bodies through surgeries or hormones. Many surgeries are
                performed on intersex people as infants.</p>

            <p>An estimated 1.7% of people are intersex. There is no exact number or percentage since some people
                are never diagnosed and tracking this information is not mandatory. In addition, there are debates
                over whether people with certain conditions are intersex or not since there is no set definition
                for what intersex includes.</p>

            <p>Intersex only refers to a person's sex, so intersex people can be any gender, sexuality, or romantic
                orientation.</p>

            <p>A person who is not intersex is endosex (also called perisex or dyadic).</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The intersex flag was created by Morgan Carpenter in July 2013. Intersex Human Rights Australia, of
                which Carpenter was a part of, wanted a unique symbol that did not come from other flags or use
                pink or blue (which are generally perceived as gendered).</p>

            <p>Each element of the intersex flag was chosen for a specific reason, with quotes from
                Morgan Carpenter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Colors and circle: "don't just avoid referencing gender stereotypes, like the colours pink and
                    blue, they seek to completely avoid use of symbols that have anything to do with gender at
                    all"</li>
                <li>Circle: "unbroken and unornamented, symbolising wholeness and completeness, and our
                    potentialities. We are still fighting for bodily autonomy and genital integrity, and this
                    symbolises the right to be who and how we want to be"</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="split-in-two">
            <div>
                <p>An older intersex flag was created by Natalie Phox on August 11, 2010. It was posted to Wikimedia
                    and incorrectly labeled as a bigender flag. Due to this mistake, it was unfortunately used as a
                    bigender flag for some time, although the author later corrected their mistake by specifying that
                    they meant bigender as in "mixed sex characteristics, not gender."</p>

                <p>Each element of this intersex flag has its own meaning, with quotes from Natalie Phox:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pink and blue gradient: "the range of sexes between male and female"</li>
                    <li>Lavender: "a combination of male and female traits"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
