            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Intersex is an <a href="../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella term</a> that refers to people 
                with sex characteristics and/or reproductive anatomy (genitalia, gonads, internal anatomy, hormones,
                and/or chromosomes) that differ from the ones associated with the male or female binary. Intersex
                people are born with these differences or develop them during childhood. Because of this, they are
                often coerced or forced to change their bodies through surgeries or hormones. Many surgeries are
                performed on intersex people as infants.</p>

            <p>An estimated 1.7% of people are intersex. There is no exact number or percentage since some people
                are never diagnosed and tracking this information is not mandatory. In addition, there are debates
                over whether people with certain conditions are intersex or not since there is no set definition
                for what intersex includes.</p>

            <p>Intersex only refers to a person's sex, so intersex people can be any gender, sexuality, or romantic
                orientation.</p>

            <p>A person who is not intersex is endosex (also called perisex or dyadic).</p>
