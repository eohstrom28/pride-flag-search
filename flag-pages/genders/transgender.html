            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Transgender (often shortened to "trans") is a term used by people who identify as a gender that 
                doesn't match the sex they were assigned at birth. Transgender only refers to a person's gender,
                so transgender people can be any sexuality or romantic orientation. Transgender
                people can use any pronouns they like or no pronouns, since
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#pronouns"> pronouns don't equate gender.</a> Transgender is also an
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term"> umbrella term</a> for non-cisgender identities
                (see more in the <a href="./transgender.html#related-identities">Related Identities</a> section).</p>

            <p>Some transgender people experience
                <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria">
                gender dysphoria</a>, meaning they experience emotional distress from the inconsistency between
                their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Some transgender people choose to transition,
                but the ways they transition can vary. Some transgender people medically transition with surgeries
                and/or hormone therapy, some change their name and/or gender marker on legal documents, some
                change their name and/or pronouns, some change their physical appearance, and some do a combination
                of some or all of these options.</p>

            <p>People who are not transgender are cisgender.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The transgender pride flag was created by Monica Helms, a transgender woman and trans activist, in
                August 1999. It was first shown at a Phoenix Pride parade in 2000. Helms decided to create a flag
                for the transgender community after speaking with Michael Page, the creator of the 
                <a href="../sexual-orientations/bisexual.html">bisexual</a> flag.</p>

            <p>The each color of the transgender flag has its own meaning. Direct quotes from Monica Helms are
                provided first:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blue: "the traditional color for baby boys", masculinity</li>
                <li>Pink: "the traditional color for baby girls", femininity</li>
                <li>White: "for those who are intersex, transitioning or consider themselves having a neutral or
                    undefined gender"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The design was created in such a way that the flag is always correct no matter which way it is flown.
                This signifies transgender people finding correctness in their lives.</p>
