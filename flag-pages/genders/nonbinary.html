            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Nonbinary (also spelled non-binary, often shortened to "enby") is a term used by people who 
                fall outside of the gender binary, meaning they are not strictly male or female. Nonbinary only
                refers to a person's gender, so nonbinary people can be any sexuality or romantic orientation.
                Nonbinary people can use any pronouns they like or no pronouns, since
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#pronouns">pronouns don't equate gender.</a> Nonbinary people can
                present in any way they like; they do not have to present in an androgynous way to be nonbinary.
                Nonbinary is also an <a href="../../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term"> umbrella term</a> for
                gender identities that fall outside of the gender binary. (see more in the
                <a href="./nonbinary.html#related-identities">Related Identities</a> section).</p>

            <p>Some nonbinary people also identify as transgender, genderqueer, and/or another label, while others
                only use nonbinary to describe their gender. As such, some nonbinary people feel in between male and
                female, some feel gender-neutral, some identify with multiple genders, some have a gender identity
                that varies over time, and some identify as a third gender (which can be culturally-specific or not).
            </p>

            <p>The following quote is from Rooster (they/them), a behavioral health technician who is nonbinary:</p>
            <p>“Labels are so annoying. Humans are not binary things. Height, weight, skin tone, hair color, they're
                all on a spectrum that is held down by language into binary concepts. I understand why social
                contracts are so important, but do they have to be so difficult? Why do I have to label every single
                part of me to be understood? I use pronouns and preferences to garner respect, but it's just another
                thing, like red hair or brown eyes.”</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The nonbinary pride flag was created by Kye Rowan in 2014 in response people wanting a nonbinary flag
                separate from the genderqueer flag. It is meant to go alongside the genderqueer flag, not replace it.</p>

            <p>Each color of the nonbinary flag has its own meaning. Kye Rowan says they represent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yellow: "those whose gender exists outside of and without reference to the
                    binary as yellow is often used to distinguish something as its own"</li>
                <li>White: "those who have many or all genders, as white is the photological presence of color and/or
                    light"</li>
                <li>Purple: "those who feel their gender is between or a mix of female and male as purple is the mix
                    of traditional boy and girl colors", "the fluidity and uniqueness of nonbinary people"</li>
                <li>Black: "those who feel they are without gender, as black is the photological absence of color
                    and/or light"</li>
            </ul>
