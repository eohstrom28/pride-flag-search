            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Genderqueer is a term used by people who fall outside of cisgender norms, the male-female
                gender binary, and/or feel like their gender is <a href="../queer.html">queer</a> in some way.
                Genderqueer only refers to a person's gender, so genderqueer people can be any sexuality or romantic
                orientation. Genderqueer people can use any pronouns they like or no pronouns, since
                <a href="../../footer/faq.html#pronouns"> pronouns don't equate gender.</a> Genderqueer people can
                present in any way they like; they do not have to present in a specific way to be genderqueer.</p>

            <p>Genderqueer people can feel like they are neither male nor female, multiple genders at once, and/or
                flucuate between genders, among many other possibilities. Some genderqueer people also identify as
                nonbinary and/or transgender, while others only use genderqueer to describe themselves.</p>

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The genderqueer pride flag was created by Marilyn Roxie in June 2011. Roxie made the original design
                in June 2010, and later changed it to have lavender, green, and white stripes in September 2010. The
                green and white were swapped to create the final design used today.
            </p>

            <p>Each color of the genderqueer flag has its own meaning, with quotes from Marilyn Roxie:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lavender: "the mixture of blue and pink (traditional colors associated with men and women,
                    present on the transgender pride flag) as lavender is meant to represent androgynes and
                    androgyny. Also represents the 'queer' in genderqueer, as lavender is a color that has long
                    been associated with 'queerness', including gay, lesbian, and bisexual communities"</li>
                <li>White: "agender identity, congruent with the gender neutral white on the transgender pride
                    flag"</li>
                <li>Green: "the inverse of lavender; meant to represent those whose identities which are defined
                    outside of and without reference to the binary"</li>
            </ul>
