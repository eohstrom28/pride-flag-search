            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because
                <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Aromantic asexual (often shortened to "aroace") is a term used by people who are both 
                <a href="./romantic-orientations/aromantic.html">aromantic</a> and
                <a href="./sexual-orientations/asexual.html">asexual</a>, or are on both the aromantic and
                asexual spectrums. Asexual people may still experience other forms of attraction and can be any
                gender; the term only refers to a person's sexual and romantic orientation. Aromantic asexual is an
                <a href="../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">umbrella term</a> for identities that are part of both
                the aromantic and asexual spectrum (see more in the
                <a href="./aroace.html#related-identities">Related Identities</a> section).</p>

            <p>Some aromantic asexual people date and/or pursue other types of relationships (such as 
                <a href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Queerplatonic_relationship">queerplatonic</a> or platonic

            <summary>Flag History and Meaning</summary>
            <p>The aromantic asexual pride flag, sometimes called the sunset aroace flag, was created by Tumblr user
                aroaesflags on December 11, 2018. It was created to include aromantic asexual people who "don't
                split their attraction in mind," which is why it does not contain purple (from the asexual flag) or
                green (from the aromantic flag). Instead, it contians blue and orange, as those colors are in
                between green and purple, and purple and green, respectively. This flag is for anyone who is on both
                the aromantic and asexual spectrums.</p>

            <p>Each color of the aromantic asexual flag has its own meaning (aside from the blues). Direct quotes
                from aroaesflags are provided:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Orange: "community...both the unity of ourselves as aroaces as well as our places in both the
                    aro and ace communities"</li>
                <li>Yellow: "love and relationships that exist outside of conventional and amatonormative ideas of
                    romantic and sexual relationships"</li>
                <li>White: "wholeness, used to represent aroaces who are aplatonic, nonamorous, or otherwise not
                    seeking a committed partnership, and also how we are all whole people on our own"</li>
                <li>Dark blue and blue: "the aroace identity as well as the spectrum of aroace identities and
                    experiences"</li>
            </ul>
