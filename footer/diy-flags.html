        <p>So you might be asking yourself, what if I don't want to buy a plasticy pride flag or I can't afford one
            from the internet? Well not to fear! You can follow the routes of our queer ancestors and make one
            yourself.</p>

        <p>Pride flags were not originally mass produced! They were hand made in basements, smokey apartments, and
            raised with the solemn understanding that they may be torn down and burned.</p>

        <p>Here are some historical examples:</p>

        <p id="subtitle">Everything from sourcing fabric to smacking that thing together</p>

        <h3>Picking your flag</h3>
        
        <p>Thanks to this lovely website, you can select a flag that has some real meaning to you. It is likely that
            you're going to put a lot of effort into this project, so I recommend you pick a flag you like!</p>

        <h3>Sourcing Fabric</h3>

        <p>Fabric is <em>very</em> easy to find if you look for it. If you have scraps from old projects, or a hoarding
            grandma, you can probably find most of your colors for free, but if you can't, here are some possible
            locations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thrift stores</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some thrift stores will have dedicated fabric sections, but you can also look through the
                        following items for fabric to be reused:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bedding and towels</li>
                            <li>Scarves and ties (you could make a very cool flag with only ties)</li>
                            <li>Men's dress shirts (lots of patterns, and generally not tailored)</li>
                            <li>Skirts (not always the best, but sometimes you can find some gold)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Remember: If it's at a thrift store, it's one step away from being garbage. Don't feel bad
                        about tearing it up.</li>
                </ul>
            <li class="spacing">Garage sales and estate sales</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you know anything about crafters, it's that we hoard up to death. If there are estate
                        sales in your area, they likely will have some sort of lovely fabric collection you can
                        rifle through.</li>
                </ul>
            <li class="spacing">Your own wardrobe</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have ruined clothes that are not nice enough to be gifted away or given to a thrift
                        store, I recommend you tear them up and use them for a flag! It adds a personal touch to
                        your work, and you aren't just chucking them in the garbage.</li>
                </ul>
            <li class="spacing">Important notes on fabric:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fabric can be <em>very</em> difficult to sew or construct with if you pick the wrong texture. When
                        sourcing for your flag, I recommend you stick to materials that are similar in thickness to
                        each other. I also recommend you avoid the following materials, unless you have experience
                        sewing with them:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spandex and athleticwear: Too stretchy (gets eaten up by your machine)</li>
                            <li>Corduroy: Way too thick, also will not flow in the breeze the way you'd like it
                                to</li>
                            <li>Silk (unless you're hand sewing): Beautiful, but can very easily be eaten by a
                                machine</li>
                            <li>Burlap: I don't know where you got burlap from but put it back!</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/mJ69C_k6hO4?si=MIgPXIT0fKLSIzrT">tutorial on the basics of pride
            flag construction by the Suffolk Public Library</a>. They have a very small version here, but it covers
            basic understanding of construction. You can also hand sew, or hot glue if you really need to, but for
            the sake of it staying together, I recommend using thread in some capacity.</p>

        <h3>Upkeep</h3>
        <p>Like any other handmade gift, you should be gentle with your new flag if you don't want to repair it
            over and over. Machine wash, air dry is usually my go-to, but check out the tags on your base fabric
            and try your best to follow that instruction. Ideally, you shouldn't be dragging your flag through mud
            or using it as a protection from tear gas, so it should be fine to lay beautifully on your wall, and
            get spot cleaned as needed.</p>

        <p>If it does need fixing however, I recommend Visible Mending. Sewing on patches in a contrasting color
            or sewing up tears in brightly colored thread will provide a wonderful motif as your flag becomes a
            mosaic of your lived experience.</p>
